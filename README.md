The form settings are now accessed directly within the FormGenerator component. When an admin user is logged in, a settings icon appears. Clicking this icon toggles the visibility of the form settings, allowing the admin to customize the questions directly within the FormGenerator interface. There is no separate "FormSettings" component or route anymore.
